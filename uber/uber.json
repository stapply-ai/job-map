      "description": "## **About the Role**\n\n## Uber Ads is one of Uber’s fastest-growing businesses, contributing directly to the company’s profitability and customer engagement. In fact, Uber’s advertising arm has rocketed from no formal ad business years ago to over a **$2 billion** annual revenue run rate. We are now embarking on the next phase of this growth by expanding Uber’s advertising reach **beyond our own platforms**. As the Head of Offsite Ads (Group Product Manager), you will lead the **0→1 development** of new advertising products that enable Uber’s enterprise and SMB advertisers to run campaigns **off the Uber platform** – reaching consumers on third-party websites, apps, and other digital channels.\n\nThis role offers a unique opportunity to build a net-new programmatic advertising business from the ground up. You will define the vision and strategy for Uber’s off-platform ads, leveraging Uber’s **first-party data** and insights to help advertisers connect with our audience across the open internet while delivering **closed-loop measurement** and ROI on ad spend. We’re looking for a **deeply technical product leader** with strong business acumen and proven leadership skills to drive this initiative.\n\n## **What You’ll Do**\n\n- **Define the Offsite Ads Strategy:** Develop and communicate a compelling product vision and long-term roadmap for Uber’s off-platform advertising solutions, aligning with Uber Ads’ overall strategy and growth objectives. You will distill this vision into clear goals that excite cross-functional partners and executive leadership.\n\n- **Lead 0→1 Product Development:** Drive end-to-end development of new programmatic advertising capabilities. This includes building or integrating a **demand-side platform (DSP)** and other offsite ad technologies to enable advertisers to buy ads across third-party sites and channels using Uber’s data. You’ll pilot innovative ad formats and targeting methods, then scale those that deliver strong results.\n\n- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Work closely with Engineering, Data Science, Design, Sales, Partnerships, and Operations teams to build and launch offsite ad products. You will lead complex projects in a highly technical domain – from real-time bidding systems to data integration – ensuring all stakeholders are aligned and deliverables are met on time.\n\n- **Advertiser Success & Growth:** Champion the needs of both **enterprise and SMB advertisers** in product design. Develop self-serve tools and intuitive workflows that allow businesses of all sizes to easily create off-platform campaigns. Partner with Uber’s Ads sales and account teams to drive adoption, gather feedback, and continually improve product-market fit for offsite offerings.\n\n- **Data-Driven Optimization:** Establish key product KPIs (e.g. offsite ad reach, click-through rates, conversion lift) and use **data-driven experimentation** to optimize performance. You will implement closed-loop measurement by connecting ad exposure to downstream outcomes (such as Uber Eats orders or rides), and iterate on the product to maximize advertiser ROI and user value.\n\n- **Industry Partnership and Compliance:** Identify and integrate with strategic partners in the advertising ecosystem (e.g. major ad exchanges, supply-side platforms, or retail media networks) to extend Uber’s offsite inventory. Ensure Uber’s offsite ads products adhere to privacy regulations and industry best practices, maintaining user trust and data security throughout.\n\n- **Team Leadership:** Hire, mentor, and lead a team of high-performing product managers and analysts as the offsite ads program grows. Foster an entrepreneurial, results-driven culture that embraces innovation and collaboration. You will also influence and coordinate with other product leaders across Uber Ads (e.g. Rider ads, Eats, CPG advertising) to create a unified, omnichannel ads platform for Uber’s clients\n\n\n## **Basic Qualifications**\n\n- **Product Management Experience:** 8+ years of product management experience delivering successful and innovative tech products – with a track record of owning products end-to-end and scaling them from concept to widespread adoption. At least 2+ years of experience managing other product managers, demonstrating strong people leadership. Bachelor degree or bachelor's degree\n\n- **Ad Tech & Programmatic Advertising Expertise:** Deep understanding of digital advertising and **programmatic ad ecosystems** – including hands-on experience with demand-side platforms, real-time bidding, audience targeting, and measurement/attribution systems. Familiarity with the offsite advertising landscape (ad exchanges, trading desks, networks, etc.) and trends in ad tech is essential.\n\n- **Technical Acumen:** Proven ability to dive into highly technical products. Comfortable discussing architecture, APIs, data pipelines, and algorithmic models with engineering teams. A STEM or Computer Science degree (or equivalent experience in software engineering) is strongly preferred, as this role requires translating complex technical capabilities into product offerings.\n\n- **Strategic Leadership & Execution:** Excellent strategic thinking skills – capable of setting a bold vision and executing against it through iterative development. You have **entrepreneurial experience** or a mindset for building new businesses (not just features) and can navigate ambiguity to create structure and clarity. Demonstrated success in driving multi-quarter product initiatives from concept to launch, especially in a nascent or 0→1 product area.\n\n- **Analytical & Data-Driven:** Strong analytical skills and a data-driven approach to decision making. Proficiency with product analytics and experimentation (A/B testing, KPI definition, SQL or data tools) to guide optimizations and validate product impact. Ability to interpret complex datasets to glean insights and continuously improve the product.\n\n- **Collaboration & Communication:** Exceptional ability to influence and collaborate across **cross-functional teams** and with executive stakeholders. Experience working closely with sales, marketing, operations, and external partners to drive product success. You communicate product plans and results clearly, adapting your message to technical and non-technical audiences\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n\n- **Domain Knowledge (Plus):** Prior experience in advertising product management or building **retail media**/ads platforms is a strong plus Familiarity with major advertising verticals – especially **Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)** – is beneficial, as many Uber Ads clients are in the CPG space. An understanding of the unique needs of CPG advertisers (e.g. brand vs. performance goals) can help shape offsite solutions.\n\nFor New York, NY-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$252,000 per year - USD$280,000 per year.\n\nFor San Francisco, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$252,000 per year - USD$280,000 per year.\n\nFor all US locations, you will be eligible to participate in Uber's bonus program, and may be offered an equity award & other types of comp.

We are now hiring a Senior Staff Engineer to **architect, productionize, and scale an autonomous support agent** that resolves customer issues end‑to‑end. Experience with **voice agents** and **agentic architectures** is a major plus. You’ll push the state of the art in GenAI for customer service—LLM orchestration, evaluation, safety guardrails, multilingual support, and real‑time voice—while holding a very high bar for reliability and cost efficiency. We are still at an early stage and value candidates with bias for action who get creative with GenAI tools to accelerate execution and experimentation.\n\n**What the Candidate Will Need / Bonus Points**\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\- What the Candidate Will Do ----\n\n1. **Own the end‑to‑end agent architecture**: agentic planning and execution loops, long-term memory, persona/voice, knowledge routing, and policy enforcement for compliant, on‑brand conversations.\n2. **Ship production systems** that handle millions of conversations with rigorous **SLOs, fallbacks, and canaries**; design graceful degradation (e.g., human handoff) and safety guardrails (prompt‑injection, jailbreak, PII redaction).\n3. **Lead voice agent initiatives**: Drive the development of Uber’s voice support agent—covering real-time speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech, natural turn-taking (barge-in and endpointing), and reliable telephony/WebRTC integration. Ensure low-latency, high-quality interactions that remain robust even in noisy environments.\n4. **Advance retrieval & reasoning**: Build next-generation retrieval and reasoning pipelines, where the agent can search across different knowledge sources, apply policy-driven tools, and call structured workflows and ensure that responses are consistently grounded.\n5. **Establish evals that matter**: offline rubrics, simulated scenarios, safety tests, cost/latency tradeoff suites, and **LLM‑as‑judge** (with calibrated human review) wired into CI/CD and experiment platforms.\n6. **Drive automation at scale**: partner with Product/Design/Operations on coverage, policy alignment, localization, and rollout strategy to better customer experience and reduce **cost per contact**.\n7. **Mentor/principal‑lead** multiple pods; set technical strategy and quality bars; coach senior engineers on agentic patterns, reliability, and experiment velocity.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\- Basic Qualifications ----\n\n1. 10+ years building production ML/AI systems; 4+ years leading complex ML initiatives end‑to‑end.\n2. Deep expertise in **LLM‑driven systems** (inference optimization, prompt/program design, fine‑tuning, distillation/LoRA, safety/guardrails, evals).\n3. Strong software engineering in **Python** plus one of **Go/Java/C++**; hands‑on with microservices, gRPC/HTTP, cloud infra, containers, CI/CD, and **real‑time telemetry/observability**.\n4. Demonstrated ownership of **high‑availability** services (SLO/SLA design, incident response, on‑call leadership, postmortems).\n5. Track record of shipping **customer‑facing** intelligent experiences with measurable impact (A/B testing, metrics literacy).\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\- Preferred Qualifications ----\n\n1. **Voice agent** background (ASR/TTS streaming, barge‑in, endpointing, telephony, WebRTC) and **conversational quality**/NLP evaluation. Patterns seen in peer roles emphasize speech + dialog quality as core skills.\n2. **Agentic architectures** in production (planner/executor, memory, multi‑step reasoning) and **RAG** over complex, policy‑heavy knowledge bases.\n3. Experience building **support automation** for large consumer platforms (routing, policy codification, internal tooling, co‑pilot/auto‑resolve).\n4. Multilingual NLU/NLG (code‑switching, low‑resource languages), hallucination mitigation, safety red‑teaming, and privacy‑by‑design.\n5. Practical expertise balancing **speed** and **reliability** at scale: experiment frameworks, feature flags, canary/guarded rollouts, and clear kill‑switches.\n\nFor San Francisco, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$257,000 per year - USD$285,500 per year.\n\nFor Sunnyvale, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$257,000 per year - USD$285,500 per year.\n\nFor all US locations, you will be eligible to participate in Uber's bonus program, and may be offered an equity award & other types of comp.

On UberEats, Restricted Items consist of Alcohol, Over-the-counter medications, Prescriptions, Tobacco and Cannabis items in eligible markets, and we are continuously looking to extend our selection coverage and pursue new categories while at the same time being socially responsible about how we sell these items to the public.\n\nIn this role, you will drive the strategy, roadmap, and thought leadership behind features that will scalably unlock new restricted item categories in new markets, strengthen our reliability and compliance in markets we’re already launched in, and accelerate growth of these burgeoning categories. You will own the end-to-end success of these categories, from optimizing how customers search and discover restricted items amongst a myriad of restrictions, to ensuring seamless and compliant deliveries through the Earner flow, to enhancing how merchants merchandise and promote these products in their storefronts. The Restricted Items team sits within the Grocery & Retail organization, a rapidly growing category on Eats with significant conviction and investment.\n\nYou will be driving projects with a broad set of cross-functional stakeholders across engineering, design, business development, sales, operations, data science, legal, privacy, and more. This role is a great fit for a PM with a real passion for solving complex problems across global markets, great technical depth, principled thinking, seasoned prioritization skills, and a mentality of starting with the customer first and working backward. This PM will be most successful if they are excited about becoming completely immersed in the Restricted Items world – you will ultimately be the subject matter expert when it comes to third party delivery of regulated items.\n\n**What the Candidate Will Do**\n\nThe opportunities to advance the restricted items charter are endless. This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling on the team:\n\n1. Drive the strategy, roadmap, and thought leadership behind features that will scalably unlock new restricted item categories in new markets, strengthen our reliability in markets we’re already launched in, and accelerate growth of these burgeoning categories\n2. Craft the foundations required to effectively unlock new restricted item business lines, driving incremental revenue in new markets we’re currently blocked in due to lack of product support for local regulations (ie. Cannabis in the US, Pharmacy in the UK)\n3. Optimize how we surface restricted items in the customer shopping journey - through search, browse, promotions, and merchandising - how can we maximize the discoverability and orderability of restricted items while still being socially responsible and adhering to regional regulations?\n4. Collaborate closely with regional operations and business partners in order to understand the local regulations and pain points related to restricted items, then synthesize the feedback across global markets to develop a strategic product roadmap to solve them\n5. Ideate on and implement innovative and effective ways to strengthen age verification flows to deter minor delivery and discourage Earner non-compliant behaviors, improving our global compliance rates\n6. Ensure the end-to-end reliability and success of trips that contain restricted items\n7. Optimize how merchants onboard and configure their catalogs for restricted items, maximizing the orderability and selection of these products\n8. Influence and collaborate with various product teams across Uber that we depend on in order to ensure compliant deliveries of restricted items (ie. Search, Earner Experience, Fulfillment)\n\n**Basic Qualifications**\n\n1. Minimum 3-5 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them\n2. Bachelor's degree or equivalent\n3. Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the meta\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n\n1. Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process\n2. Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner’s problems\n3. Finger-tippiness with data. You find a way to get the data you need and whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage this data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis\n4. A “Driver” mindset. You are biased toward action, a great collaborator, a master disambiguator/simplifier, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery\n5. Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands-on\n6. A high bar across the board — from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on\n7. A true passion for Uber’s mission, our products, and the company’s hybrid technology/operations nature\n8. A never-ending desire to grow and learn\n\n**Bonus Points For**\n\n1. Experience building products from 0 to 1\n2. Experience in the grocery, retail, CPG or ecommerce industry\n3. Experience working across global requirements and expertly synthesizing them in order to craft a scalable product roadmap\n4. Experience working with local regulations and/or age verification technologies\n\nFor New York, NY-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$161,000 per year - USD$179,000 per year.\n\nFor San Francisco, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$161,000 per year - USD$179,000 per year.\n\nFor all US locations, you will be eligible to participate in Uber's bonus program, and may be offered an equity award & other types of comp.

      "description": "**About the Role**\n\nAt Uber, we reimagine the way the world moves for the better. There are several operations and technologies that enable this mission and Uber’s GSS (Global Scaled Solutions) org, now externally known as Uber AI Solutions, leads many of those capabilities such as data annotation, generation and evals for AI/ML innovation, app testing, localization/internationalization, map editing, digitization programs and more. We combine technology and human intelligence optimally to run these scaled programs. To do this efficiently and with high quality, we have built industry leading tech and ops muscle and have now externalized the same.\n\nThe tech+ops solution coupled with Uber’s strength of building a platform for flexible work will enable enterprises world-wide to accelerate their data, AI and product journeys. We have seen a lot of positive traction and demand from enterprises as we incubated this business and now are looking to grow this into a meaningful business line for Uber. While we do this, we look forward to creating flexible earnings opportunities through digital tasks for millions of people across the world. Together, our tech, operations expertise and platform for knowledge work are uniquely positioned to be the best-in-class human in the loop solution for the industry.\n\nOne of the capabilities we are growing is data collection - both in field and remote - with customers across Gen AI, Autonomous Vehicles, Mapping, Telco, CPG/Retail and more. With unparalleled access to our earner network globally and tech capabilities, we aim to be a leader in the space and are looking for experts to help build and shape this capability.\n\n**About the role**\n\nWe are building one of the most scalable, high-quality data collection engines powering the next generation of AI. Our projects span audio, image, video, LiDAR, text, and multimodal datasets, across dozens of countries and environments.\n\nWe are looking for a Program Manager to own and drive complex, multi-country data collection programs end-to-end.\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who has thrived in startup environments where speed, hustle, and creative problem-solving matter more than rigid process. You will manage diverse contributor networks, oversee global operations, and ensure datasets meet strict client standards and high quality, at scale.\n\n**What you will do**\n\n1. **Program Management and Ownership:** Translate client SOWs into executable programs — scope, timelines, budgets, workforce model, and quality control frameworks.\n2. **Execution Excellence:** Solve operational bottlenecks in real time — whether it’s participant churn, equipment issues, location access, or low-quality submissions - and ensure program delivery and success. Build processes, systems and playbooks that help scale data collection programs systemically\n3. **Quality & Compliance:** Ensure data meets specs, surpasses accuracy thresholds, and complies with privacy/consent/data protection laws globally.\n4. **Stakeholder Management:** Act as the program point of contact with clients, internal teams, and external vendors. Provide progress reports, risk assessments, and mitigation plans.\n5. **Analytics & Reporting:** Monitor collection KPIs via dashboards, identify issues early, and drive corrective action.\n6. **Continuous Improvement:** Codify learnings into playbooks and SOPs for repeatability and faster future deployments.\n7. **Cross-functional collaboration and influence:** Influence our tech roadmap to build a world class data collection engine. Work with privacy, legal, ops and supply teams to unlock new use cases, markets and scale programs\n\n**Basic Qualifications**\n\n1. 5+ years Experience in program management or operations\n2. Exposure to AI/ML data programs, sensors, or field data collection.\n3. Multi-country operations experience\n4. Proven track record managing large-scale distributed programs, ideally in data, logistics, field operations, or crowdsourcing.\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n\n1. Strong program management fundamentals — planning, governance, risk management.\n2. Hands-on hustler who thrives in ambiguity and doesn’t wait for perfect instructions.\n3. Exceptional stakeholder management — from C-level clients to field contributors.\n4. Data-driven operator — comfortable with metrics, dashboards, and root-cause analysis.\n5. Bias for action, resilience under pressure, and ability to work across cultures and geographies.\n\nUber's mission is to reimagine the way the world moves for the better.

With millions of couriers providing on-demand logistics through our existing marketplaces around the world, Uber Direct is a product that allows all merchants, who want to leverage a vast network of delivery partners, to do so and fulfill the on-demand last-mile delivery service for orders on their own app and websites.

This ecosystem empowers every Mobility Operations staff member to understand the ground truth of our business quickly.\n\nThe Global Performance Analysis (GPA) Lead challenges executive leadership to focus on the biggest, most consequential aspects of business performance. In doing so, this role enables a globally aligned ‘management by exception’ model where regional teams contextualise business performance via a global lens, and challenges from executives steer operations analytical capacity to be focused on the most globally-relevant questions and assumptions.\n\nThis role, which is anticipated to build out a small team of direct report ICs over time, will utilize (and motivate) new global analytical tools to achieve a deeper level of understanding of our business performance than we’ve ever had before; deep diving on metric trends, relationships, inter-dependencies, variabilities, sensitivities, uncertainties, risks, assumptions and BBQs (‘big bold questions’) with a particular focus on (1) understanding how our business is evolving / will evolve over the next 3-5 years, and (2) identifying what we can do NOW to optimise performance later.\n\nThis role will work closely with the Global Head of BizOps and the Head of Global S&P to evolve the content of Uber Mobility’s executive materials, and will work closely with BizOps “Economic Performance” and other Ops counterparts in each region, to ‘operationalise’ a model where all ‘top down’ challenge and questions are appropriately contextualised, framed, prioritised and reported back on. The GPA Lead will also work with these regional and local stakeholders to help shape and contextualize/couch ‘bottoms up’ findings in a way that they can be immediately understood within the existing executive narrative of performance.\n\n### **What You'll Do**\n\n- **Analyze global business performance** using advanced analytical tools and surface key insights, risks, opportunities and questions.\n- **Maintain a constantly updated perspective** of the most important global and regional performance characteristics and update this view in light of new signals. “What should we care about right now?” and “are we focusing on the right topics?” are your P0 concerns\n- **Enable and coordinate a ‘management by exception’ model** across global and regional operations teams, enabling all analytical efforts to be applied in a prioritised and efficient manner.\n- **Deep dive on priority questions, hypotheses and opportunities** to understand ground truth and report back to Mobility leadership on what’s happening and whether we should consider taking action\n- **Maintain a clearly documented and transparent PoV** on the most important BBQs (Big Bold Questions) and Assumptions on which business strategy is based. Use this to help organise analytical resources where appropriate to answer BBQs and challenge assumptions.\n- **Face off to regional BizOps Economic Performance Leads** (and/or their Ops equivalents) in each region, to ensure a coherent and globally scaled approach to cost saving, cost avoidance, capacity release and capacity re-investment; as a mechanism for freeing up resources to be re-focused on globally prioritised regional topics\n- **Develop deep SME knowledge of the economics and dynamics** of Uber’s mobility business, and use this to steer, coach, challenge leaders. Ultimately, this role will also contribute to the development of semantic layers for future biz performance focused AI-interfaces.\n- **Provide input to the DMAP Design Lead** w.r.t. what analytical tools, models and other capabilities should be prioritised for development, and/or where specific or bespoke requirements exist to enable us to solve gnarly problems or go after outsize opportunities\n\n**Basic Qualifications**\n\n- **Experience:** 8+ years of experience designing, building \\*and\\* using internal analytical tools within a data-driven organization to analyse and report on business performance.\n- **Business Acumen / Intuition:** Deep understanding and intuition for the drivers of business performance within a complex and dynamic marketplace environment, and an ability to go beyond the data to consider the ‘so what’ and zero in on P0 characteristics\n- **Technical:** Strong data visualisation skills (R, Python, Tableau, Looker Studio, etc.); you’re able to perform exploratory data analysis to rapidly deep dive into topics and analyse them / diagnose them / develop recommendations\n- **Quantitative:** STEM background with experience in time series analysis; this can be in financial services, hedge funds, or in industrial / medical fields. The key is demonstrated experience interpreting multivariate performance trends and using this to challenge the consensus view of performance.\n- **Communication & Influence:** Able to articulate complex analysis in simple terms for senior leaders and a wide variety of other stakeholders; without losing the richness of insights. I.e. being ‘as simple as possible but no simpler’\n- **Stakeholder Management:** Acts as a coach and partner to a large number of global and regionally located stakeholders; enabling, steering, challenging and nudging in a way that builds trust rather than erodes it\n\n**Preferred Qualifications**\n\n- A combination of Quantitative PhD and industry experience\n- Has held a quantitative analyst role analysing the performance of portfolios of assets.\n- Has experience of business performance analysis within retail or consumer industries\n- Quantitative consulting experience a big plus; with examples of the findings you surfaced / the value these brought to your clients\n- Comfortable being hands-on / working quickly with R, Python, and coding-based statistical & analytical tools.
